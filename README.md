Showcase of the game:

Program is started by using the "python jump" command in the command line.

In the game you can move the player character left and right using both the left and right arrows or the a and d buttons.
Holding down the spacebar, the player charges the character's jump, and said character jumps upon the spacebar's release.
If the directional keys were held down during release the character will then travel in said direction.
Once in the air the player is not allowed to change the character's trajectory.
Player is required to reach the top of the level where a princess is located.
The game also contains a debug function which allows the player to shift to the next screen by pressing n. 
This function can however warp the player out of the map.
The game is a clone of a indie platformer game 'Jump King'





The tests are activated using the "pytest jump" command in CLI.
